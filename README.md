# Udacity-Project-Movie-Trailer-Website

In this project, we will create a website that will display our favorite movies and will also play the trailer of a particular movie when the poster is clicked on.

Steps :
1. Python is needed to run this program. 
2. Use this link to download Python : https://www.python.org/downloads/
3. You may download either Python 3.6.4 or Python 2.7.14, however it is recommended to use version 2.7.14, as the code for this project was created using that version.
4. After you have downloaded python, open the setup wizard, follow the instructions given and complete the installation.
5. Once Python is installed, open the following link https://github.com/kvothebloodless247/Udacity-Project-Movie-Trailer-Website and download the python files there.
6. After this is done, you may open any of those files on Python to observe the code there.
7. To open the Movie Trailer Website, open entertainment_center.py and run the module using F5.
8. Your browser will open a new page titled "Trailer website for the Hobbit and LOTR Series!".
9. The page contains a list of movies from the Lord of The Rings and The Hobbit Trilogy.
10. Clicking on any of the movie portraits will play the trailer of that movie.
